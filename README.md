ReplicableAnalysis
==================

*Update, post unblinding: The goal of this project was not perfection in experiment nor analysis. The point was to demonstrate that a replicable measurement is possible and that it's possible to do non-trivial unblinding in public. A quick glance at the paper and presentation will trivially reveal that they are not complete, yet the primary goal was accomplished.*

*I may return to the project to polish the code, but my priority at present lies with my thesis work. Please clone the project, and build it on your own machine, just to see how it works!*

This repository documents a blind replicable-analysis measurement of the density of water, to be unveiled at the NIST Big G meeting in October 2014.

To build this project, you need GNU make, GNU Octave, Gnuplot, and the usual complement of UNIX tools present on a Linux system. Clone the repository, and run 'make'.
