This repository documents a blind replicable-analysis measurement of the density of water, to be unveiled at the NIST Big G meeting in October 2014.

To build this project, you need GNU make, GNU Octave, Gnuplot, and the usual complement of UNIX tools present on a Linux system. Clone the repository, and run 'make'.
