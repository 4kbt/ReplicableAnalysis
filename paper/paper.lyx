\begin_layout Title
Replicable Analysis: determination of the density of water
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Charles Hagedorn
\end_layout

\begin_layout Address
As a demonstration of replicable analysis software, a small example can
 be instructive.
 This paper was automatically generated from raw data and source code available
 at https://github.com/4kbt/ReplicableAnalysis.git .
 In this work, we seek to determine the density of water, relative to a
 calibration mass and an ensemble of gauge blocks.
 The experiment will be unblinded in public at the NIST Big G meeting in
 October 2014.
 While care will be taken to ensure that the result is accurate, the importance
 of this measurement is that it can be readily be audited by anyone.
 We find the density of water to be

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper is designed as an introduction to the idea of replicable analysis.
 This paper is entirely computer-generated from data and source code available
 at https://github.com/4kbt/ReplicableAnalysis.git .
 As a small example, we attempt a measurement of the density of Seattle
 City water sourced from a tap in our laboratory shop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This measurement was performed blind, and was unblinded in public by the
 measurement of two key experimental dimensions at the NIST Big G meeting
 in October of 2014.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An absolute measurement of the density of a material requires, at a minimum,
 two things, a measurement of mass and a measurement of volume.
 In this work, we measure the density of water by measuring the mass of
 water displaced by an object of a known volume.
 This method allows the straightforward measurement of the exterior of a
 convex object (in this case, a right cylinder) rather than the greater
 challenge of characterizing the interior of a concave water-holding vessel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is necessary that the displacing object be more dense than water so that
 its displacement may be trivially-known.
 It is advantageous if the density of the displacing object is comparable
 to the liquid density to be measured, in order to minimize any influence
 of the scale's nonlinearity.
 For this reason, we selected a plastic from a blank found in our laboratory's
 machine shop.
 For this measurement, the mass need not be internally-uniform, as only
 its volume is of direct importance to the measurement.
 Indeed, prior to the unveiling of the the blind, we have no idea what the
 composition of the plastic is.
 The plastic was observed to be denser than water, our only major requirement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plastic blank was machined by weighing and cutting, without reference
 to any calibrated length standard, to a goal of 100

 The uniformity of the machining was checked using dial indicators without
 an absolute reference, as seen in Figure

 The diameter was observed to have

Software tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software tools used to generate this document and the associated presentatio
n are all open-source and freely-available.
 The source code is managed under Git, an industry-standard program.
 The build recipe was controlled using GNU Make; there may be better alternative
s, but Make is a stalwart.
 The majority of the computation was done using Octave, a GNU implementation
 of the MATLAB language.
 Plots were generated using Gnuplot.
 For batch image processing, ImageMagick was used.
 The usual supporting software of any GNU/Linux operating system (sed, bash,
 etc) was also used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software libraries utilize internal tests to help ensure expected behavior
 on multiple architectures.
 While the unit-test coverage is not complete, the reader is referred to
 the source code to see which checks are applied, and how.

Linearity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linearity of the scale was assessed using an ensemble of ostensibly-identica
l screws from our shop.
 All of them were weighed on the balance individually, and all of those
 used read 6.4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

g.
 The scale was tared and calibrated, and then the scale readings recorded
 as screws were added to and then removed from the pan, spanning the scale's
 entire rated dynamic range.
 The results are plotted in Figure

reference "fig:Linearity-test,-done"

.
 The instrument's performance is impressive for a $25 scale.

Hysteresis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linearity data-taking sequence can also be used to extract information
 regarding the hysteresis of the scale.
 In Figure

reference "fig:Linearity-test,-done"

\end_inset

, we plot the residuals with different colors as weights are being added
 to the scale and as weights are removed from the scale.
 By eye, it is clear that there was either a small instrumental drift or
 that the scale exhibits hysteresis at the
