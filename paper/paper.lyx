\begin_layout Title
Replicable Analysis: determination of the density of water

\begin_layout Address
As a demonstration of replicable analysis software, a small example can
 be instructive.
 This paper was automatically generated from raw data and source code available
 at https://github.com/4kbt/ReplicableAnalysis.git .
 In this work, we seek to determine the density of water, relative to a
 calibration mass and an ensemble of gauge blocks.
 The experiment will be unblinded in public at the NIST Big G meeting in
 October 2014.
 While care will be taken to ensure that the result is accurate, the importance
 of this measurement is that it can be readily be audited by anyone.
 We find the density of water to be

\begin_layout Standard
An absolute measurement of the density of a material requires, at a minimum,
 two things, a measurement of mass and a measurement of volume.
 In this work, we measure the density of water by measuring the mass of
 water displaced by an object of a known volume.
 This method allows the straightforward measurement of the exterior of a
 convex object (in this case, a right cylinder) rather than the greater
 challenge of characterizing the interior of a concave water-holding vessel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is necessary that the displacing object be more dense than water so that
 its displacement may be trivially-known.
 It is advantageous if the density of the displacing object is comparable
 to the liquid density to be measured, in order to minimize any influence
 of the scale's nonlinearity.
 For this reason, we selected a plastic from a blank found in our laboratory's
 machine shop.
 For this measurement, the mass need not be internally-uniform, as only
 its volume is of direct importance to the measurement.
 Indeed, prior to the unveiling of the the blind, we have no idea what the
 composition of the plastic is.
 The plastic was observed to be denser than water, our only major requirement.
